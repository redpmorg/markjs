# MarkJS #

## Simple and pure ReactJS CMS ##

Mark CMS is a project started a few years ago!
Mark CMS is an architectural concept implemented already in:

- PHP ZendFramework
- Symfony 2.8
- Python Django

Mark CMS can be a valuable help for starting any project.

Here with **MarkJS** we struggle to implement same concept in pure [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

For styling we are implementing [Material-UI](https://material-ui-next.com/) but [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) can be also used.
